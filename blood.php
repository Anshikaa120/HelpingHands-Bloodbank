                    <p class="lead" style="color:rgb(2, 2, 2);" >Each day, thousands of people need donated blood and blood products to keep them in good health or allow them to stay alive.

                        If a person’s blood levels fall due to an accident or illness, or if their blood is not functioning properly, there will not be enough oxygen or other nutrients to maintain their vital organs.
                        
                        Donating whole blood can help these people. </p>
                        
                       <p class="lead" style="color:rgb(2, 2, 2);"> Blood donation not only saves lives but also has key benefits that we are unaware of.  
                        It balances the level of iron in the body, regulates blood flow, reduces the risk of cardiovascular
                         disease and stroke, triggers production of new blood cells and helps in weight loss. Moreover,  
                         donating blood had a positive effect on a donor’s physical and psychological well-being as well.

                        If you are planning to donate blood, then firstly get yourself registered. 
                        A person can donate blood either in a licensed blood bank, blood donation 
                        camps or at a blood mobile. Although the blood donation process usually takes 
                        not more than 15 minutes, the entire process right from registration, medical check-up, 
                        donation and post-donation rest doesn’t exceed more than 30 minutes. </p>
